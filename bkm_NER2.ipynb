        "Black holes are one of the most fascinating and mysterious phenomena in the universe. They are regions in space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. The boundary surrounding a black hole is called the event horizon, and once an object crosses this boundary, it is pulled irreversibly toward the center. The first ever photograph of a black hole, located in the M87 galaxy, was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019. This breakthrough provided scientists with direct visual evidence of a black hole’s existence.\n",
        "The concept of black holes dates back to the early 20th century when Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity predicted their existence. Over the years, astronomers have discovered that black holes come in various sizes, from stellar-mass black holes formed when massive stars collapse, to supermassive black holes at the centers of most galaxies, including our own Milky Way.\n",
        "Despite their immense gravity, black holes do not \"suck in\" everything around them. Objects that are far enough away from the event horizon will not be affected. However, black holes have been found to influence the motion of stars and gas in their vicinity, shaping galaxies in ways that are still being studied by astrophysicists.\n",
        "In 2021, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch, is expected to provide further insights into the behavior of black holes and their impact on galaxy formation. The mysteries of black holes continue to captivate scientists, and with upcoming advancements in technology, we are likely to learn even more about these enigmatic space objects in the coming decades.\n",
